    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cheesy corndog casserole has the comforting flavors of a corndog with far less effort.</p>
    <p>Hot dogs, cheese, and corn bread mix combine in an easy casserole.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped green onion</li>
        <li>8 hot dogs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages corn bread mix, such as Jiffy</li>
        <li>8 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Grease a 3-quart baking dish.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add celery and onions and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add hot dog pieces to the same skillet and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to mixing bowl with veggies.</li>
        <li>Add in milk, eggs, mustard, hot sauce, cornbread mix, and 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese; stir until combined (itâ€™s ok if some lumps remain). Pour into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle any remaining cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set, 25 to 30 minutes. A toothpick inserted near the center should come out fairly clean. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
